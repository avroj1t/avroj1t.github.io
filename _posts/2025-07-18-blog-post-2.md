# 📈 Introduction to Statistics

**Statistics** helps us make sense of data by summarizing it, estimating unknowns, and testing ideas.

- **Descriptive statistics**: Summarize data  
- **Inferential statistics**: Make predictions or generalizations  
- Applied in biology, medicine, engineering, psychology, economics, etc.

## 🧩 Describing Distributions

### **Measures of Location**
- **Mean** – average value  
- **Median** – middle value  
- **Mode** – most frequent value  

> These describe the "center" of the data.

### **Measures of Spread**
- **Range** – difference between max and min  
- **Quartiles** – divide data into four parts  
- **Percentiles** – value below which X% of data falls  
- **Deviation** – difference from the mean  
- **Variance** – average of squared deviations  
- **Standard deviation** – square root of variance

> These show how *scattered* the data is.

## 🎲 Probability Foundations

### **What is Probability?**
- The likelihood of an event occurring  
- Expressed between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain)

### **Law of Total Probability**
If A can happen through exclusive events B and C:
```math
P(A) = P(A|B) × P(B) + P(A|C) × P(C)
```

---

## 🧠 Bayesian Thinking

### **Bayes’ Theorem**
Helps update belief in a hypothesis given new data.

```math
P(H|D) = [P(D|H) × P(H)] / P(D)
```

### **Example: COVID-19 Testing**
Even with a 99% accurate test, if prevalence is low (e.g. 1%), many positives may be false due to the base rate.

---

## 🎯 Probability Distributions

### **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**
- For **discrete** variables  
- Assigns probabilities to individual outcomes  
- Example: Coin toss

### **PDF (Probability Density Function)**
- For **continuous** variables  
- Probability = Area under the curve  
- Example: Human height

---

## 🔔 Normal Distribution

- Symmetrical bell curve  
- Defined by **mean (μ)** and **standard deviation (σ)**  
- Most biological measurements follow this

---

## 🧪 Sampling: Population vs Sample

- **Population** – entire group (e.g., all adults in India)  
- **Sample** – subset used to infer about the population  

> Sampling must be **random and unbiased** to ensure valid conclusions.

---

## 🎯 Estimating Parameters

### **Point Estimate**
- A single value (e.g., sample mean) used to estimate a population parameter

### **Central Limit Theorem**
- The distribution of the sample mean becomes **normal** as sample size increases, even if the original data isn't normal

---

## 🧮 Confidence Intervals

Used to show a **range** where the population value likely falls

- **Confidence level** – how sure we are (e.g., 95%)  
- **Margin of error** – how much the sample estimate may vary

```math
CI = sample mean ± z × (σ / √n)
```

---

## 🤔 Hypothesis Testing

### **Goal:**  
Test if a difference/relationship is statistically significant

- **Null hypothesis (H₀)** – no effect/difference  
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)** – there is an effect

### **Errors:**
- Type I (α): False positive (rejecting true H₀)  
- Type II (β): False negative (failing to reject false H₀)

### **P-value**
- Probability that observed data is due to chance  
- If **p ≤ α (e.g. 0.05)** → reject H₀

## 📏 Parametric Tests

| Test        | Use Case                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Z-test      | Known variance, large sample size    |
| T-test      | Unknown variance                     |
| Paired T-test | Same subjects before/after         |
| Two-sample T-test | Compare two independent groups |
| ANOVA       | Compare 3+ group means               |
| F-test      | Compare variances between 2 groups   |

---

## 🧪 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Used to test differences across **3+ groups**

### Types:
- **One-Way ANOVA** – one factor  
- **Two-Way ANOVA** – two factors, also tests interaction

### Assumptions:
- Independence  
- Normality  
- Equal variances  

### Key Terms:
- **SSB**: Variation *between* groups  
- **SSW**: Variation *within* groups  
- **F-ratio**:  
```math
F = MSB / MSW
```

> If F is large, likely that group means differ significantly.

## 🧰 Non-Parametric Tests

Used when assumptions of normality or equal variance don’t hold

| Test                    | Used For                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Mann-Whitney U**      | Compare two independent medians          |
| **Wilcoxon Signed Rank**| Paired samples without normality         |
| **Chi-Square Test**     | Relationship between categorical variables |
| **Kruskal-Wallis**      | Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA      |

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Examples

- **Body Fat Study:** Use 2-sample t-test to compare men vs women  
- **Teaching Effectiveness:** F-test to compare variance in student scores  
- **Diet Study:** One-way ANOVA to compare 3 diets’ weight loss  
- **HIV Drug Trial:** Mann-Whitney test for viral load comparison  
- **Learning Preference vs Gender:** Chi-square test for association

---

## 📚 Practice Problems

1. **Normal range**: What is the central 95% range for μ = 80, σ² = 144?  
2. **Cholesterol study**: Do Asian immigrants differ significantly in cholesterol?  
3. **Normality check**: Use a sample of weights to test for normal distribution.  
4. **CLT demonstration**: Use different sample sizes to show CLT in action.
